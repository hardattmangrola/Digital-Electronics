# Digital Electronics - Logisim Practicals & Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Digital Electronics** practicals implemented in **Logisim**, focusing on fundamental circuits such as counters, adders, and registers. It also contains my **innovative assignment** – a **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**, designed using digital circuit principles.

## 🔥 Features
### 🔹 Logisim Practical Circuits
- **Counters** (Up/Down, Modulo-N)
- **Adders** (Half Adder, Full Adder, Ripple Carry Adder)
- **Registers** (Shift Registers, Parallel Load Registers)
- **Multiplexers & Decoders**

### 🔹 Fibonacci Sequence Generator
- Implements a Fibonacci sequence generator using **flip-flops and adders**.
- Demonstrates a **practical approach to recursive number generation** in digital logic.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Logisim** (for circuit design & simulation)
- Basic understanding of digital electronics and logic gates

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hardattmangrola/Digital-Electronics.git
   ```
2. Open the `.circ` files in **Logisim** to simulate the circuits.
3. Modify and experiment with the designs to understand their working.
